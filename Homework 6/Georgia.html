    <h1>Census Data Choropleth: Georgia Education</h1>
    <h2 style="color:green">Steve Wilmot</h2>
    <h3>Below is an image of the state of Georgia as a Choropleth. The data presented in the map is the educational attainment by people between the ages of 18-24 years olds. The data used was provided by the US Census website and shows how educational different parts of Georgia are. You can see in the map how there are very few areas with extremely high levels of education but that also deals with population size. Population size can skew data to look one when it doesn't tell the whole truth.</h3>
